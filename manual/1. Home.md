## Background
LinguaCafe is a self-hosted web-app for learning foreign languages by reading.

I developed LinguaCafe mainly for personal use, because I found the alternative platforms too expensive or lacking in features I wanted.  After years of development and reading other language learners' opinions about similar platforms, I realized that it might also be a useful tool for other learners, so I have started adding more features to grow LinguaCafe into a platform that more people can benefit from.  

With LinguaCafe you:
- **Can read the source code and contribute features.** LinguaCafe is an open-source software, which means the code is readily available to you, you can copy it and use it according to the license, and contribute features.
- **Can self-host.** LinguaCafe is self-hosted, which means it runs on your machine or potentially in a private web server and thus be accessible to you on the internet.
- **Control your data.** Because you host LinguaCafe yourself on your machine, you own your data and can do whatever you want with it. 
- **Pay nothing.** LinguaCafe doesn't have a price tag, it is completely free.

## User manual
Writing the user manual is an ongoing process, it will be expanded and improved regularly.
