                The docker installation process has been improved since the last version. Fixed all the known issues with it, and 
                removed the requirement for users to create their folders manually and to modify the docker-compose.yml file.

                <br><br>
                There were several issues with Jellyfin integration. Now it should work properly with every language and video type. 
                Also added information about subtitle file naming to the readme file. <br><br>

                Lemma modifications only apply to new words that haven't been imported yet. There will be an option in the future, to 
                overwrite already existing lemmas.<br><br>

                    <li>
                        Fixed an issue on the vocabulary search page, that caused phrases to be displayed with commas 
                        between the words, or with no spaces between them. It will still need further improvement for 
                        non Japanese and Chinese languages.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fixed an error that broke the Kanji page if you had no known Kanji yet from every category.

                <b>Other changes:</b>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Removed all online dependencies.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Updated language selection dialog design, and the supported languages information in the readme.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Changed chapter size from 9000 to 4000 characters for importing e-books due to performance issues. There will be an option
                        to edit this limit soon.

                    <li>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Added dynamic subtitle rendering for Media player, which increased performance significantly. For this I had to remove 
                        customizable spacing between subtitles, due to a bug that moved the vocabulary box around. This will be fixed in the
                        future.

                        "Hide all highlighting" and "Hide new word highlighting". This makes it possible to hide only the
