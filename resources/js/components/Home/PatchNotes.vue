                <b>New features:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Replaced the python Django server with Bottle for better performance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Added dynamic language model loading. Models are only going to be loaded at the first import for each language. This will significantly decrease memory use based on which and how many langauges are used on a server after its startup.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Added new "Plain text" import option.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Added dictionary search for hover vocabulary box.

                    <li>
                        Added DeepL search for hover vocabulary box.

                    <li>
                        Separated DeepL search from regular dictionary search in the vocabulary box. Users won't have to wait for DeepL server's response to see the dictionary search results which load much faster.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Added loading indicator for vocabulary box dictionary search.

                    <li>
                        Added an option to automatically highlight a word when it gets a translation added to it. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A list of words which were not counted in the statistics now will be automatically set to ignored when imported. Also added all numbers and more symbols to the list.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Vocabulary search page's edit dialog now will close on its own after saving it, and the search results will be updated automatically.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The selected library layout will now be remembered.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Added option to change the default MySQL database and user.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Added windows installation guide and installation file.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>

                    </li>
                    <li>

                        Fixed a visual issue where the scrollbars' background were a different color than the area they were placed on.

                    <li>
                        Furigana now displays the editable reading field. Previously it displayed the reading that was assigned to the exact word in text while importing it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fixed a visual issue where the day text was not visible in the calendar while using dark theme.

                    <li>
                        Added a minimalistic vocabulary box, that appears when the user moves the mouse over a word. It can be turned off in the text reader settings.

                    <li>
                        Increased maximum execution time for importing dictionaries. If your dictionary import did not end with a success message but still functional, I recommend importing it again, because it probably did not import all the records from the dictionary file.

                The docker installation process has been improved since the last version. Fixed all the known issues with it, and 
                removed the requirement for users to create their folders manually and to modify the docker-compose.yml file.

                There were several issues with Jellyfin integration. Now it should work properly with every language and video type. 
                Also added information about subtitle file naming to the readme file. <br><br>

                Lemma modifications only apply to new words that haven't been imported yet. There will be an option in the future, to 
                overwrite already existing lemmas.<br><br>

                        Added dynamic subtitle rendering for Media player, which increased performance significantly. For this I had to remove

                        The "Highlight words" option in the text and subtitle reader settings dialog has been split into 2 options: 
                        "Hide all highlighting" and "Hide new word highlighting". This makes it possible to hide only the 
                        yellow new word highlighting.

                    </li>
                    <li>Fixed a bug that caused words to only have top and bottom border without background when "Highlight words" option was turned off, 
                        and the user hovered over them.
                    </li>

                        There was a non-standard scroll function used that caused issues in some browsers.

                        An issue has been fixed that caused white space characters being displayed as clickable words 
                        on the text reader page, and it broke the software if the user clicked on them.

                        All tokenizer models have been replaced with smaller sized ones due to possible performance issues. They will be replaced 
                        with larger models for specific languages if it causes word tagging accuracy issues.
